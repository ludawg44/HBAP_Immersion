### Introduction

Welcome fellow HBAPers! We created this site to help inform, connect and guide first time and second time immersion participants. We’ve taken the advice, suggestions and consult from prior graduating classes and feel this is the best way to enhance your immersion experience - whether it’s your first or last. 

### Who We Are

We’re a collective group spanning multiple cohorts. Spearheaded by Scott Suckow, we are united to improve your social experience during the immersion. 

### What We Want to Accomplish

We hope that you find this useful and are able to collaborate with your fellow HBAPers to maximize your time during the immersion. We do not have any affiliation or are partnered with the program or school. We’re full-time, part-time students of the program volunteering on our own. We don’t get paid for this.
